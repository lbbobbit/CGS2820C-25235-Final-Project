				<p>Music has been a staple in popular culture since the dawn of time.</p>
				<h2>What is Music?</h2>
				<p><strong>Music</strong> is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.[1] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "(art) of the Muses")</p>
				<br>
				<p>Music can be divided into genres and genres can be further divided into subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. </p>
				<br>
				<p> This website will talk about 4 specific genres that have unique ties to each other, Hip Hop, Lo-Fi, Electronic, and Rock. </p>
